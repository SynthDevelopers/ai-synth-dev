ðŸŽ¨ /creative/ â€” Visual & Conceptual Seed Prompts

This folder offers prompt structures to generate ideas for:
- Visual scenes  
- Narrative motifs  
- Color-coded emotions  
- Spatial compositions

These are **starting signals**, not finished thoughts.  
Use them to break the blank page, or to echo your internal vision into something the machine can translate.

ðŸ”¹ Prompt 01: Atmosphere Builder

Instructions:
- Focus on lighting, texture, and feeling  
- Use weather, color, and ambient details as emotional symbols  
- Do not include text or logos  
- Output should feel like a memory, not a moodboard

Example input:  
> A scene that feels like calm before the storm. Teal mist, soft pavement reflections, empty neon-lit cafÃ© window.

ðŸ”¹ Prompt 02: Conceptual Echo Generator

Give me five visual ideas that reflect this abstract concept:

> _"Digital memory meets forgotten ritual."_

Each idea should include:
- A short title  
- A one-line scene description  
- The dominant color  
- The emotional undertone

Do not describe the output as art or photography. Let it stand as **conceptual fuel**.

These seeds are meant to spark vision â€” not replace it.  
You are not generating images.  
You are **initiating signals**.
