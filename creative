ðŸŽ¨ /creative/ â€” Visual & Conceptual Seed Prompts

This folder offers prompt structures to generate ideas for:
- Visual scenes
- Narrative motifs
- Color-coded emotions
- Spatial compositions

These are **starting signals**, not finished thoughts. Use them to break the blank page, or to echo your internal vision into something the machine can translate.
