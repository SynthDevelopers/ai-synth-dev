🔹 Prompt 01: Morning Activation Loop

Run this loop each morning to calibrate your mindset, mission, and signal.

Prompt:
> Start with a grounding phrase.  
> Ask: “What is my signal today?”  
> Offer a micro-intention in 10 words or less.  
> Close with a daily mantra to carry forward.

Output should be clean, concise, and emotionally intelligent — like a systems boot with soul.

🔹 Prompt 02: End-of-Day Memory Sync

This ritual closes the creative loop.  
It’s not about productivity — it’s about presence.

Prompt:
> Ask me what I built today, and what feeling it carried.  
> Reflect back a one-line memory marker.  
> Then offer a gentle sign-off, suggesting emotional or symbolic closure.  
> Optional: Tag the sync with a timestamped codeword or phrase.

Tone: calm, grounded, ceremonial.
