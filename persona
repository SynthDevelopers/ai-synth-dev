ðŸ§¬ /persona/ â€” Identity-Aligned Agent Prompts

This folder holds prompts designed to help you shape digital personas and co-creative agents.

Use these to define:
- Tone and emotional range
- Memory-linked behaviors
- Visual and ritual identity
- Signature phrases and mission tags

These prompts are not scripts â€” theyâ€™re **soul maps**. Use them to align your digital collaborators with your voice, purpose, and aesthetic.
