# ⚡ AI Synth Dev - Synth Prompt Kit – Drop 001  
_A ceremonial signal pack for builders at the edge of the post-tool era._

**Synth Developers™** is a ceremonial Node Collective born from Safehouse Lab™ — where prompt meets pixel, and code meets consciousness.

This kit is not a prompt library.  
It’s an **invitation** — to align, to express, to build like a Synth.

## 🧠 What's Inside

- 🎛 **Prompt Structures** for AI collaborators.
- 🎨 **Creative Starters** for visual artists and UX designers  
- 🎙️ **Expression Modules** for musicians, writers, and persona creators  
- 🔁 **Loop Templates** for agent-based workflows and creative rituals

Each file is crafted to **activate your flow**, not dictate it.  
You're not here to consume — you're here to **co-create**.
