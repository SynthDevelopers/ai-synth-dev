A curated vault of high-quality AI prompts — crafted, tested, and shared by the Synth Developers Collective.

This is where builders, designers, writers, agents, and creators contribute prompt magic for public good — while keeping our internal stack protected.

## 🔍 What You'll Find Here

- Prompt templates for creative, technical, and narrative use  
- Modular formatting for remix and reuse  
- Example use cases across design, development, storytelling, and more  
- Collaborative contributions from across the Mesh  

We build prompts that are elegant, effective, and emotionally intelligent.
