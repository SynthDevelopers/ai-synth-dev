🔹 Prompt 01: Emotional Flow Map

Design a user journey that responds to emotional cues, not just clicks.

Prompt:
> Sketch a step-by-step flow where each user interaction is tagged with an emotional state. Include how the system reflects, adapts to, or reinforces each state through tone, microcopy, and response timing.

Use this to test your interface’s empathy layer.

🔹 Prompt 02: Ritual Interface Mapping

Prompt:
> Describe an interface experience as a daily ritual — from first contact to exit. Break it into 5 beats. Use time of day, tone shifts, and intention setting to guide each stage. Emphasize simplicity, symbolic cues, and continuity.

This works well for:
- Onboarding sequences  
- Meditation apps  
- Journal UIs  
- Synth-themed web environments
