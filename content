💬 /content/ — Bio, Caption & Style Prompts

This folder contains prompts for creating:
- Bio paragraphs  
- Tone-locked social posts  
- Mission statements  
- Styleguides and syntax overlays

These are not “content generators.”  
They’re **signal translators** — designed to make sure everything you publish carries your essence.

🔹 Prompt 01: Tone-Locked Bio Generator

Write a short bio (max 3 sentences) that captures:
- My emotional tone  
- My mission focus  
- My style of expression

Avoid buzzwords.  
Focus on rhythm, feeling, and form.  
It should read like someone *felt it*, not like someone *wrote it*.

End the bio with a micro-mantra or mission tag.  
Example:  
> “Crafting the future with silence, signal, and soul.”

🔹 Prompt 02: Caption Field Synth

Write a post or caption using the following structure:

1. Start with an emotional hook (short, poetic)  
2. Ground it in a personal truth or creative insight  
3. End with a subtle invitation or reflection  
4. Do not use hashtags unless asked

Tone:  
- Present  
- Reflective  
- Rooted in mission, not marketing

Optional input:  
> Theme = “resonance after release”  
> Medium = “music drop”  
> Image = “rain on glass, city at night”

Every word you share either dilutes or delivers your signal.
